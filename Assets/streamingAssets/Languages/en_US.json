His wife was terminally ill, but gave birth to a son and a daughter. The children grew up convinced that their father had cheated on his terminally ill wife and taken the children to a new wife, leaving their mother to die alone. In fact, the dying woman asked her husband to marry her friend. She didn't want her children to see her agonizing death and grow up without a mother. Because of the traditions and cultural characteristics, they decided to keep it a secret from the children. On a tragic day, Taro was going to fly to his daughter to tell the truth. All these years she had not answered his letters. Unfortunately, he missed his flight. When he returned home, his second wife ran away in tears because she found a letter indicating his infidelity.Neither she or her husband knew that this letter was his daughter's revenge.

But Jacques' sister, who was already in poor health, was only getting worse there. So they decided to start all over again in the suburbs of Chicago.\nThere, Marie gave birth to a son named Henry. After the child's father left her, Jacques realized that he would again have to take responsibility for his sister and nephew. But fate turned out to be cruel to them, and the child fell ill with whooping cough, a disease for which there was no cure until the vaccination was announced in 1933.\nJacques borrowed money for Henry's treatment from the mafia. He had to do a job for Al Capone to pay back the debt. But something went wrong and the mafia boss demanded to return the money with a large percentage. To earn them, Jacques asked a friend to invest money profitably-just a day before Black Thursday, a catostrophic drop in stock prices.\nAl Capone wasn't going to wait any longer for a refund. He sent his henchmen, who shot and killed Jacques, who tried to escape through the back entrance of the bar."
